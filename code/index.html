     <p class="article"> For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent 
          than dolphins because he had achieved so much—the wheel, New York, wars and so on—whilst all the dolphins 
          had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. 
          But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man—for precisely the same reasons.

          <h2 class="news-grid-heading">"I'd far rather be happy than right any day"</h2>
          <p class="news-grid-article"> This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. 
            Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, 
            which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.

           <h2 class="news-grid-heading">Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.</h2>
           <p class="news-grid-article"> Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. 
             Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive 
             that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
