# News Site

Assignment to create a news site with focus on learning how to use flexbox and/or grid system. Site is also supposed to work responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop. 

## The problem

Had a lot of problems in the beginning with how to use flexbox. Used the “ a complete guide to flexbox '' and the “complete guide to grid” that was linked in our project site to finally solve some problems. Also had a lot of help from asking in stackoverflow and reading others questions as well. 
did a very simple plan in the beginning but ended up working a bit unstructured. It was first after creating a better structure and focusing on one problem at a time that I got more effective and did the biggest leaps forward.
